# Circuits

Circuits is a library which provides a simple implementation of the [Circuit Breaker]  pattern.

##Installing via Nuget
```
Install-Package slingn.circuits
```

###Usage
Without pre configuration
```
CircuitBreaker.Execute("MY CIRCUIT NAME", () =>
{
    //application logic here
}, break_limit, break_duration);

```
With pre configuration
```
CircuitBreaker.Add("MY_CIRCUIT_NAME", break_limit, break_duration)
```

```
CircuitBreaker.Execute("MY CIRCUIT NAME", () =>
{
    //application logic here
});
```

###Overview
The Circuit Breaker keeps track of a named Action which allows the "Circuit" to be disconnected when the number of exceptions generated by the given Action have been met for a specified duration of time.

For example, let's say you need to contact a web service or a database to retrieve information and you want to ensure that when the service/database is unavailable your application will stop attempting to contact the service/database for 30 seconds.

To do so, you can wrap your service/database call inside of the CircuitBreaker.Execute method.
